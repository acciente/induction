<!-- The purpose of this file is to demonstrate all the possible parameters that may used to configure
     Induction. It should be noted that typically most Induction configurations will not use all the parameters
     shown here. -->

	<!-- The java-class-path section allows you to specify locations from which
	Induction will automatically reload classes -->
	<java-class-path>
		<compiled-directory>
			<directory>\a\directory\with\class\files\to\be\reloaded\dynamically</directory>
			<!-- If the above directory points to a subfolder of the folder where the package
			folder structure begins, then specify package represented by the subfolder -->

	<!-- The following section allows you define the models used your application.
	A model definition must specify a <class> and a <scope>. The <class> specifies
	the name of the model class. The value specified for the <class> must be a fully
	qualified classname.

	If a model class implements an interface and it is desired that references to
	the model (in the controllers) be via the model interface, then the interface
	name implemented by the model must be specified as the <class> here, instead
	of the name of model implemention class. The scope must contain one of the
	following values: application, session, request (case insignificant).

	For most real-life applications, each model class will have a factory class
	specified. The model's factory class will be used by Induction to instantiate
	objects of the respective model class. If no factory class is defined Induction
	will expect the model class to have a single public constructor, which Induction
	will call with parameter injection semantics. -->
