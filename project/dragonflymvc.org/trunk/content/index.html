<H2>dragonFly MVC -- Official Website</H2>
<H3>What is dragonFly MVC?</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">dragonfly MVC is a Java(tm) web
application development framework. The goal of dragonFly is to
simplify the development of high-performance, maintainable web
applications using Java(tm). dragonFly MVC is a 100% pure Java(tm)
implementation that runs inside a servlet container. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Other popular web applications
frameworks for Java that may be compared to dragonFly include Spring
MVC, Struts, Tapestry, WebWork and JPublish. 
</P>
<H3>What motivated dragonFly MVC?</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There is already a large number of web
application frameworks for Java, so why another Java web application
framework? Very simply, it was felt that there is still room for
significant improvement. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Following are some of the specific
motivations for dragonFly: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It should not be necessary to
	redeploy an application every time Java code is changed. It should
	be possible to simply recompile the changed source (hopefully using
	your favorite IDE) and simply reload the respective web page. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It should be possible to use
	mature Java dependency analysis tools in an IDE to analyze the
	dependencies between models, views and controllers (For example:
	Which controllers use this model object? What controllers will be
	impacted if I edit this template?) 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An application should not be
	cluttered by superfluous XML configuration files. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The measure of improvement is perhaps
ultimately subjective, and there are many perspectives to a problem,
so feedback from the community at large is greatly appreciated. 
</P>
<H3>dragonFly MVC quick user guide</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">dragonFly MVC advocates the use of the
Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm to web application development.
Following is a brief of the summary of how dragonFly MVC supports
models, views and controllers. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In dragonFly MVC you will write the
important types of classes you will write are controllers, views and
models. A very simple application may only use controllers, but most
applications will use controllers, views and models. 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Controllers</B> 
	</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All requests are processed by a
		controller 
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A controller is a POJO which
		implements the Controller marker interface (the Controller
		interface just marks a class as a controller, and does not enforce
		any methods) 
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A model object or environment
		object (such as the Request, Response or Form) is accessible in a
		controller by simply declaring a parameter of the model object's
		type in the controler's respective method (this is referred to
		&quot;parameter injection&quot; in dragonFly) 
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A controller may have a method
		for each distint task that it performs 
		</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The default URL to controller
			mapper, allows specifying the controller class and method name in
			the path to invoke a controller, e.g:
			http://www.dragonflymvc.org/myapp/controller/Signup/save, where
			the controller class is myapp.controller.Signup and a method named
			&quot;save&quot; should be invoked on the class 
			</P>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Omitting the method cause an
			assumed (configurable) method name to be called 
			</P>
		</UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The type of the return value of a
		controller is significant, each possible type and their meaning is
		given below: 
		</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Template: processes and return
			the content of the specified template object to the client 
			</P>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Text: returns the text contents
			to the client 
			</P>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Image/ImageStream: returns the
			image contents to the client 
			</P>

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Views 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Models</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pure application logic,
		completely independent of views and controllers 
		</P>
		<LI><P></P>
	</UL>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">- views - a view class is a POJO that
implements one of the following interfaces (based on the type of
view): - Template - Image - Text - ImageStreamer - a class, say C1,
that implements the Template interface uses one of the integrated
template engines - when processing the template the only data passed
to the template is an instance of the class C1 - so C1 serves as the
bean that defines clearly what data is uses by the associated
template - models - a model is any user defined class - a
configurable factory may be provided for each model class -
declarative control of the lifecyle of each model class -
application: a model object is created for the life of the
application - session: a model object is created for each browser
session - local: a model object is created for each controller
invocation
