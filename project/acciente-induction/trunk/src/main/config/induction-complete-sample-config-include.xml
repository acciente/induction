<!--	A sample include file to illustrate loading of configuration from an additional file. 
	A sample configuration file is loaded using the webapp classloader's getResourceAsStream() method,
	note that it uses the webapp classloader not the Induction classloader, since the latter is not yet
	initialized at this point.
	
	Also note that the included config file must follow the same syntax rules as the main config file, 
	in particulat it cannot conatin part of a config file. Therefore all include included files start 
	with <config> just like	the main config file.
